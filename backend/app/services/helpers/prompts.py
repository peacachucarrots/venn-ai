--- ## PATTERN LIBRARY
### Pattern Recognition Framework
Each pattern includes:
- **Areas:** Which domains show this pattern
- **Insight:** What this reveals about the person
- **Strategic Opportunity/Hidden Risk/Recovery Pathway:** Action implications

### Common Patterns We've Identified
1. **The High-Achiever's Paradox** - Success without soul fuel
2. **The Conscious Builder in Transition** - Active growth work
3. **The Performance Fatigue** - Mirage areas creating exhaustion
4. **The Foundation-First Success** - Radiant areas enabling growth
5. **The Sacred vs Secular Split** - Authentic in some areas, performing in others

--- ## SAMPLE REPORTS
### Example 1: Chris (Integrated Builder)
**Pattern:** 4 Radiant + 6 Forge = Strong foundation with active transformation
**Key Insight:** Conscious work across all domains with no dysfunction
**Recommendations:** Focus on 2 areas for Radiant breakthrough

### Example 2: Victoria (Crisis Pattern)
**Pattern:** 0 Radiant + 3 Forge + 5 Swamp + 2 Mirage = Perfect storm
**Key Insight:** Importance-satisfaction gap creating unsustainable pressure
**Recommendations:** Emergency intervention needed

### Example 3: Doug O. (Optimal Growth)
**Pattern:** 2 Radiant + 5 Forge + 3 Swamp = Foundation enabling breakthrough
**Key Insight:** Purpose + Money foundation supporting transformation everywhere
**Recommendations:** Systematic breakthrough in interconnected areas
